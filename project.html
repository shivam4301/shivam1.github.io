                <h3>Index Typewriter</h3>
                <p>This is the complete design of the new masterpiece.It came into the market in the early 1880s. The index 
                 typewriter uses a pointer or stylus to choose a letter from an index. The pointer is mechanically linked so
                 that the letter chosen could then be printed, most often by the activation of a lever.</p>
